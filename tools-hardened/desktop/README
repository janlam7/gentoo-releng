Kernel Requirements:
====================

On the host system, these packages need to be installed:

* sys-kernel/hardened-sources-3.14.2-r1
* sys-kernel/linux-firmware-20131230
* sys-kernel/genkernel

Once you emerge these things, create a symbolic link of the hardened-sources
to point to "/usr/src/linux-tinhat".

After this you need to apply the Loop-AES patch by doing the following:

* cp ./config/loop-AES-kernel-3.14.patch /usr/src/linux-tinhat/

Then apply the patch:

* rm -f drivers/block/loop.c include/linux/loop.h
* patch -p1 < loop-AES-kernel-3.14.patch

To run:
=======

Execute ./<DM>-run.sh

Where <DM> is a desktop manager of three flavors of choice:

* Fluxbox
* Gnome3
* Xfce4

When your ISO is built, you can clean up by removing the th-<ARCH>-<DM>/
directory as it is no longer needed.

Enjoy! ;)
