This is not ready yet for a full catalyst run.  However,
if you have a musl chroot (which you can get from any
gentoo mirror off of /experimental/amd64/musl) then you
can build a new stage by running ./run.sh.  It basically
uses the `ROOT=rootfs emerge -e @system` technique.

Once more stuff is integrated into gentoo, we will replace
this with a catalyst scripts.
